/**
 * The Utopian tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. The first growth cycle of the tree is during the monsoon season when it doubles in
 * height. The second growth cycle is during the summer when it increases in height by 1 meter. If a new Utopian tree sampling of height 1 meter is
 * planted just before the onset of the monsoon season, can you find the height of the tree after N cycles?
 * 
 * Input Format The first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of testcases. T lines follow each line containing the integer N,
 * indicating the number of cycles.
 * 
 * Constraints 1 <= T <= 10 0 <= N <= 60
 * 
 * Output Format Print the height of the Utopian tree after N cycles.
