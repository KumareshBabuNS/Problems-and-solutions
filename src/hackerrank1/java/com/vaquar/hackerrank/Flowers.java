/**
 * You and your K-1 friends want to buy N flowers. Flower number i has minCosts ci. Unfortunately the seller does not like a customer to buy a lot of
 * flowers, so he tries to change the price of flowers for customer who had bought flowers before. More precisely if a customer has already bought x
 * flowers, he should pay (x+1)*ci dollars to buy flower number i. You and your K-1 friends want to buy all N flowers in such a way that you spend the
 * least amount of money possible. You can buy the flowers in any order.
 * 
 * Input:
 * 
 * The first line of input contains two integers N and K (K <= N) next line contains N positive integers c1,c2,â€¦,cN respectively.
 * 
 * Output:
 * 
 * Print the minimum amount of money you (and your friends) have to pay in order to buy all N flowers.
