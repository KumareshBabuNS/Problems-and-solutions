myStay — simplified hotel browsing!

[Problem Statement]

Develop a WebApp which would help travellers interactively like, save and share hotels online.

[Minimum Requirement]

— Page with an interactive design displaying hotel details (fetched from API).

— A downloadable hotel detail; in either an image (JPG/PNG etc) OR a document format (DOC/PDF etc).

— Emphasis on UI/UX and design of web app; Use your favourite javascript framework.

— Submit the source code.

[Plus Point]

— Feature to slide/navigate hotels.

— Extra: API Hit Count / Number of hotels.

— Awesomeness: Like and Share Hotels; as well as Download hotel details.

— You may add portfolio page/link comprising awesome work you have done on web applications.

— Use your imagination to come up with additional features to simplify exploring hotels.

[Guide]

— Hotel API: http://glydel.0x10.info

— use your favourite backend language to code around (Optional Technology Stack: Python and any JS Framework).

— jQuery, angularJS or any of your favourite client side scripting language is plus!

— For bootstrap/icons/fonts/textures:

http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/

http://glyphsearch.com/

http://subtlepatterns.com/thumbnail-view/

https://www.google.com/fonts

— Though the application can be build without storing any data in a database but if you can build an option of storing the data in a backend or HTML5 LocalStorage, you will get extra points for that.

— You can use any simple database like LocalStorage, SQLite or MySQL, and while submitting your solution ZIP, include the SQL file along with instructions to set up the database.
