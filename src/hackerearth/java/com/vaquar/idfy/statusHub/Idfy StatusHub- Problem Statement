[Problem Statement]

Develop a web application which would help end users list and browse member details.

[Minimum Requirement]

— Fetch member details via given API. (having 1500+ records).

Data Parameters: members[] —> { id, status, ethnicity, weight, height, is_veg, drink, dob}

status AS text (profile description)

ethnicity AS integer (1-9)

weight AS integer (in grams)

height AS integer (in centimetre)

is_veg AS boolean

drink AS boolean

dob AS date

image AS text (Avatar Image url)

^ Some parameters may have null value in it; handle it carefully!

• convert ethnicity from integer to Text.

• convert weight from grams to Kilograms

— List status and categorise ethnicity.

— Submit Screenshots, Documentation and Source code with instruction.

[Plus Point]

— a feature to add infinite scroll and utilise API paging.

API Limits response to max. 10 records and add paging: /idfy-member?page=1
— Easy setup with instructions and documentation to make deployment easier.

— A feature to favourite status and list favourited status (RoR).

— Implement meaningful Graph from member’s height and weight with respect to min/max height and weight (if time permits).

* height # (min: 142, max, 208)         [in CM]
* weight # (min: 36.3, max: 108.8)  [in KG]
— Add Download option to download member details (as PDF) [Via RoR].

— Use your imagination and add features which would make feature rich web app; we always admire creativity.

[Advance Level] (Optional / If time permits)

— Implement Search (by status, height or ethnicity) feature.

— A feature to filter Vegan in list. Also Share member status across social media.

— Do the statistical analysis on ethnic group if time permits.

i.e. percentile number of Asians, average height/weight, number of drinkers and non-drinkers.
— Handle Input Exceptions, Unicode and Null values. Beautify; Comment; Documented code.

— Awesome If you could manage to host this application somewhere with Demo URL! (heroku or AWS)

— You may add portfolio activity comprising awesome work you have done on web applications.

[Guide]

— Member API: https://idfy.0x10.info/

Use this gist to convert Ethnic number to Text: https://gist.github.com/mayurah/ade1e2666b651b7e5c4a
— Given mockup design is just for reference, you may come up with your own design and layout.

— Emphasis on backend to manage favourites and download feature.

— Ideal Stack:

You shall use RoR, any SQL/NoSQL to handle backend operations.

Feel free to use any front-end layout to simplify user experience (any CSS, JS framework).
