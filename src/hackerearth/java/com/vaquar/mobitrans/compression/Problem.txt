My task was to implement a method which performs basic string compression by counting sequences of repeating characters. Given "aaabbbccc" it should return "a3b3c3". I have included some sample tests I made up. Please let me know if I have missed any cases. I am looking for the fastest implementation possible with the most concise code. I'm looking to cut down on if else statements or give them simpler logic if possible.
